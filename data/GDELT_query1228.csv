Brian McGregor.""A projectile had entered the lower left side of Skeith abdomen and exited approximately three inches higher from his right torso,"" McGregor says the autopsy showed them. ""It was determined at autopsy that the location of the gunshot wound, the trajectory of the projectile, and the lack of marks from discharging a firearm at close range, that Skeith did not fire the weapon.""McGregor says when detectives confronted Wix, she changed her story and admitted she shot Skeith:""Wix claimed that on the night of incident, she and Skeith was in their upstairs bedroom.  Skeith had a firearm in his waist band and made an aggressive move in her direction with his body while standing across from her.  Wix first advised that Skeith's movement frightened her, at which time she retrieved her 9mm handgun from an end table and pointed it at Skeith and shot him.
